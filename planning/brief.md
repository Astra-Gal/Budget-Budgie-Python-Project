### Spending Tracker

Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.

#### MVP

* The app should allow the user to create and edit merchants, e.g. Tesco, Amazon, ScotRail
* The app should allow the user to create and edit tags for their spending, e.g. groceries, entertainment, transport
* The user should be able to assign tags and merchants to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
* The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view, with each transaction's amount, merchant and tag, and a total for all transactions.

#### Inspired by:

Monzo, MoneyDashboard, lots of mobile/online banking apps

#### Possible Extensions

* The user should be able to mark Merchants and Tags as deactivated. Users will not be able to choose deactivated merchants/tags when creating a transaction. 
* Transactions should have a timestamp, and the user should be able to view transactions sorted by the time they took place.
* The user should be able to supply a budget, and the app should alert the user somehow when when they are nearing this budget or have gone over it.
* The user should be able to filter their view of transactions, for example, to view all transactions in a given month, or view all spending on groceries.

# Project - Web Programming with Python

:star: Remember to gather PDA evidence :star:

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Python
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Python
* Flask
* PostgreSQL and the psycopg

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

All of these will be covered later in the course. Do not make any attempt to use them this week, even if you've used them before.

Make lots of little (but sensible!) git commits. The number of commits in your final submission is one of the criteria your work will be judged on.

## Briefs

The briefs detail what is expected of you, including an MVP. Note that the MVP is the **Minimum** Viable Product. You are strongly encouraged to go beyond these specifications, and some possible extensions are provided.

Talk through your ideas with an instructor during the planning process, and before you begin coding.

## Submission

Submit a link to your Github repo through the Homework Submission form as soon as the repo has been created.

Your code will be reviewed with an instructor on Wednesday afternoon.

## Presentation

Presentations will be held on Thursday. You will have 10 minutes to present your work, with 5 minutes for questions.

We expect you to:

* Show your sketches, notes, diagrams, wireframes and user planning
* Demonstrate your app's functionality
* Talk about some code that you are particularly proud of
* Highlight your main learning points

Do not:

* Talk through every single line of code
* Go over the time limit

Due to the numbers rather than presenting to the whole class, we will do presentations in groups. 

## Asking for help

The instructional team will be on hand for technical assistance, but you are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to practise self-sufficiency, as will be expected of you as a professional software developer.

When problems arise, remember the 4 'B's and follow the order:

- Brain (read the error message, rubber ducking etc)
- Book (Google, research)
- Buddy (fellow students)
- Boss (Instructors)

Before asking an instructor for help this week, you should be ready to answer the following questions:

* What are you trying to achieve?
* What do you think the problem is?
* What have you tried so far?
* What did Google say about your error message?

If you do need help then send a Slack message to the classroom channel so we can get to you in turn. 

## Instructor Meetings

You will each have at least two meetings with an instructor during the project - on Monday and Wednesday. The Monday meeting will be a 10-minute(ish) chat to see how things are going. On Wednesday the instructor will go through your code with you - you should be able to explain your code to the instructor.

## Attendance

The cohort will meet at the usual time every morning. Your attendance is recorded every day as normal.

Remote students should stay on the Zoom call so that instructors can help if required. We will probably create breakout rooms so each student can have their own breakout room which an instructor can join if they require assistance.

For those of you on campus, we will be using two classrooms. Once assigned a seat/classroom you should use that same seat/classroom for the entire week.

## PDA Reminder:

As part of this project you are required to take screenshots of the following:

```
- A Use Case Diagram  
- A Class diagram  
- An Object diagram  
- An Activity Diagram
- A user sitemap
- Two wireframe designs
- An example of pseudocode for a function
- One of your projects where you have worked alone and attach the Github link
```

Show user input being processed according to design requirements. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user inputting something into your program
- The user input being saved or used in some way
```

Show an interaction with data persistence. Take a screenshot of:

```
- Data being inputted into your program
- Confirmation of the data being saved
```

Show the correct output of results and feedback to user. Take a screenshot of:

```
- The user requesting information or an action to be performed
- The user request being processed correctly and demonstrated in the program
```

Produce an Implementations Constraints plan detailing the following factors:

```
 - Hardware and software platforms
 - Performance requirements
 - Persistent storage and transactions
 - Usability
 - Budgets
 - Time   
```

- Submit your PDA evidence (screenshots, etc.) to Canvas
